## MIT App Inventor IoT for Hobbyists

# Welcome, Makers!

The maker movement has drawn enormous vitality over the past decade
from two computing breakthroughs. One is mobile computing: we now carry with us computers of tremendous power that link to vast resources of data and computation. The other is the Internet of Things (IoT), which brings an entire
realm of physical objects within the scope of digital sensing and
control.

MIT App Inventor (IoT) combines these two advances.  With it, you can
create mobile apps for smartphones and tablets that control IoT
sensors, actuator and other devices.  Programming for IoT uses the same
blocks-based drag-and-drop interface that's made App Inventor so easy to
use&mdash;even for beginners.

The apps you make with MIT App Inventor IoT can read information
from a panoply of sensors (temperature, moisture, voltage,
pressure, noise, heart rate, chemicals, etc.) and control a host
of devices (buttons, buzzers, lights, appliances, robots, etc.).
Best of all, you can run these apps from your smartphone, and take advantage of all the features that App Inventor provides, including speech understanding, language translation and Web communication.

In order to make App Inventor IoT apps, you'll need an <em>IoT
controller</em> to manage communication between the devices and your
phone.  This first release of MIT App Inventor IoT supports the
Arduino 101 and the BBC micro:bit controllers, with support for more
controllers coming soon.
