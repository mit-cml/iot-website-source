## MIT App Inventor IoT for Young People

# Welcome, Students!

You might know that MIT App Inventor lets you create exciting apps for
smartphones and tablets with your friends and classmates. Now, with the Internet of Things extension to App Inventor (MIT App Inventor IoT), your apps can connect to physical and digital objects all around you!

You can build apps that control lights, buttons, buzzers, motors,
robots, electrical appliances and a growing universe of connected
devices. You can use sensors to capture a wealth of data, including temperature, sound, light, color, moisture, motion, touch, heart rate, and much more, with support for new sensors appearing daily. You can combine controls and sensors with all the other features of your App Inventor apps, like speech recognition, databases, and communication.

To build IoT apps you'll need an <em>IoT device controller</em>, which
connects to the various devices and manages the communication with your
smartphone.  One of the most popular device controllers for IoT
development is the Arduino, but there are other controllers
available.

This first release of MIT App Inventor IoT supports the Arduino 101
and the BBC micro:bit controllers, with support for more controllers coming soon.
