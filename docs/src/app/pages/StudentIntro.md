## MIT App Inventor IoT for Young People

# Welcome Students!

You might know that MIT App Inventor lets you create exciting apps for
smartphones and tablets with your friends and classmates. Now, with
the Internet of Things extension to App Inventor (MIT App Inventor
IoT) your apps can connect to physical and digital
objects all around you!

You can build apps that control lights, buttons, buzzers, motors,
robots, electrical appliances and a growing universe of connected
devices.  You can choose from a wealth of sensors&mdash;for temperature, sound,
light, color, moisture, motion, touch, heart rate and many
others, with new sensors appearing daily.  You can combine controls
and sensors with all the other features of your App Inventor apps like
speech recognition, databases and communication.

To build IoT apps you'll need an <em>IoT device controller</em>, which
connects to the various devices and manages the communication with your
smartphone.  One of the most popular device controllers for IoT
development is the Arduino but there are other controllers
available.

This first release of MIT App Inventor IoT supports the Arduino 101
and the BBC:Microbit controllers, with support for more controllers coming.
