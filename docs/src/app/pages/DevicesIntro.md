# IoT Devices
To connect with the world of IoT you need an IoT device. An IoT device allows you to connect and control a whole range of inputs and outputs (sensors, motors, switches, etc.).

Currently, App Inventor supports the [Arduino 101](#/arduino101/arduino101intro) and [BBC micro:bit](#/microbit/microbitintro) devices.

Before building your IoT creations you need to set up your environment. See [Getting Started](#/getstarted/intro) for instructions.

Next, we need to learn how to build an App Inventor app that can connect to our Arduino. At present, we use Bluetooth to connect to our IoT Devices (we are working on WiFi). Building a basic app that can connect via bluetooth is easy. You can find [tutorials here](#/teachers/tutorials).

# Documentation
