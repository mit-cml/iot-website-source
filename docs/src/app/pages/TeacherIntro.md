## MIT App Inventor IoT for Educators

# Welcome Teachers!

The Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to transform modern
living&mdash;with estimates of more than 20 billion connected devices
worldwide by 2020.

You already know that MIT App Inventor lets you 
help your students create original mobile apps
that can make real-world differences to themselves and their communities..

Now with MIT App Inventor IoT your students can build apps that
communicate with physical and digital objects all around them.  MIT
App Inventor IoT extends the reach of mobile apps to sensors,
actuators, robots and an expanding universe of connected
devices.

The biggest difference between ordinary MIT App Inventor apps and
MIT App Inventor IoT apps is that 
**IoT apps connect to and communicate
with external devices.** One of the most common device controllers for developing for IoT is
the Arduino (arduino.cc) but there are other controllers on
the market. **Your students can connect all kinds of sensors** (like
sensors that can tell the temperature, or the level of noise in a room)
**and other inputs** (like buttons and switches) to a controller. They
can use App Inventor to program the controller to **trigger
the connected devices** (like turning on a light,
playing a sound, or moving a motor), **or signal events to other devices,
including smartphones.**

This first release of MIT App Inventor IoT supports the Arduino 101
and the BBC:Microbit controllers, with support for more controllers coming.
