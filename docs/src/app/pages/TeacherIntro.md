## MIT App Inventor IoT for Educators

# Welcome Teachers!

The Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to transform modern
living&mdash;with estimates of more than 20 billion connected devices
worldwide by 2020.

You may already know that MIT App Inventor lets
you help your students create original mobile apps that can make
real-world differences to themselves and their communities.
Now with MIT App Inventor IoT your students can build apps that
communicate with physical and digital objects all around them.
App Inventor IoT extends the reach of mobile apps to sensors,
actuators, robots and to an expanding universe of connected
devices.

The biggest difference between ordinary MIT App Inventor apps and MIT
App Inventor IoT apps is that IoT apps communicate with
external devices through device controllers. One of the most common device controllers for
IoT development is the Arduino but there are other
controllers on the market. Your students can connect all kinds of
sensors (like sensors for temperature, or moisture, or noise, or
light, or color, or motion) and other devices (like buttons and
switches and relays) to a controller.  They can then use App Inventor
to program the controller to trigger the connected devices (like
turning on a light, playing a sound, or moving a motor), or signal
events to other devices, **including smartphones running App Inventor
apps**.

This first release of MIT App Inventor IoT supports the Arduino 101
and the BBC:Microbit controllers, with support for more controllers coming.
