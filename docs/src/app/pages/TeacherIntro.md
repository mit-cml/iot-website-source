## MIT App Inventor IoT for Educators

# Welcome, Teachers!

The Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to transform modern living&mdash; with estimates of more than 20 billion connected devices worldwide by 2020.

You may already know that MIT App Inventor helps your students create original mobile apps that can make real-world differences for themselves and their communities.

Now, with MIT App Inventor IoT, your students can build apps that communicate with physical and digital objects all around them. App Inventor IoT extends the reach of mobile apps to sensors, actuators, robots, and an expanding universe of connected devices.

The biggest difference between ordinary MIT App Inventor apps and MIT App Inventor IoT apps is that IoT apps communicate with external devices using <em>IoT devices controllers</em>. One of the most common controllers for IoT development is the Arduino, but there are other controllers on the market.

Your students can build apps with all kinds of sensors (like sensors for temperature, moisture, noise, light, color, or motion) and other devices (like buttons, switches, and relays) connected to a controller. Using App Inventor, they can program controllers to trigger connected devices to activate sensors, turn on lights, play sounds, move motors, and more! Students can even control the devices from their smartphones!

This first release of MIT App Inventor IoT supports the Arduino 101 and the BBC micro:bit controllers, with support for more controllers coming soon.
