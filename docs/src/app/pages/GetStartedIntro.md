## Getting Started with MIT App Inventor IoT

You may already know how to build mobile apps with
MIT App Inventor, but if you are new to this system, please
<a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/tutorials.html" target="_blank">click here</a> to become familiar with some basic functions in MIT App Inventor.

<b>Hardware</b><br>
To build Internet of Things (IoT) apps with MIT App Inventor, you will be working with external
hardware. In addition to your laptop and Android mobile device, you will need the following:

- [Arduino 101](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoard101) is the first IoT device controller to be
included in the MIT App Inventor IoT release. Future releases will include other controllers.
- [SEEED Grove Shield](http://www.seeedstudio.com/Base-Shield-V2-p-1378.html) works with the Arduino 101 to easily
attach sensors and modules.
- Sensors as needed for specific projects

<b>Setting up your computer (~ 30 minutes)</b><br>
You will first need to <a href="/assets/tutorials/MIT_App_Inventor_IoT_Setup.pdf" target="_blank">install software and set up your computer</a>
to work with the Arduino 101 device controller. You will then need to
<a href="/assets/tutorials/MIT_App_Inventor_Basic_Connection.pdf" target="_blank">connect to the Arduino 101</a> using MIT App Inventor.

<b>Start with a simple IoT app (~ 30 minutes)</b><br>
Before you begin with a full tutorial or a How To exercise, you may want to start with a simple app to turn an LED light
on and off. This <a href="/assets/tutorials/MIT_App_Inventor_IoT_Starter_Tutorial.pdf" target="_blank">Starter Tutorial</a> will take about 30 minutes.

<b>Then try a How To sensor app</b><br>
Now that you have tried the Starter Tutorial, you may want to try connecting with different types of sensors and
modules such as:

- <a href="/assets/howtos/MIT_App_Inventor_IoT_Temperature_Sensor.pdf" target="_blank">Temperature sensor</a>
- <a href="/assets/howtos/MIT_App_Inventor_IoT_Button.pdf" target="_blank">Button</a>
